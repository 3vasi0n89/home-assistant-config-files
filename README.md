My Home Assistant Configuration Files for my Symbtiote Smart House Project.
I'll do my best to keep these files updated regularly!

# Background

A little bit of background about the hardware and software that I utilize for my house.

I run my Home Assistant off of a docker on my Unraid Server.
Ever since I made the switch from the Raspberry Pi 3 to Unraid I have noticed significant differences in speed between how fast my automations trigger
and how smoothly everything runs; On top of that the reboot times are between 10-30 seconds now instead of the upwards of 5 minutes that the RPi3 took.
